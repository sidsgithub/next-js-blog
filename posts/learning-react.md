The two Important sources for learning react apart from the react docs were: **Random React-centric Blogs on Medium** and **Stack-overflow**. As we know react components can be : 

- **Class Based** Components that rely on classes and use of **this keyword**.
- **Functional** Components that are fully based on use of functions.

When I started learning React, Hooks were intruduced, which helped managing states in functional components a whole lot easier. Hence encouraging the use of functional components.
